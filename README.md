This is milindCal, the best productivity software ever created (ever).
What you do is you input the tasks you're wanting to remember, a short description of the task, how long you think it'll take, and it's relative importance. And then milindCal 
(the amazing lil piece of software it is) will organize the tasks for you in the order in which you should do them, helping you get things done the right way. It's algorithm sorts the tasks in inverse proporation to how long they take to complete and to how important the task is. There is some data validation such that you enter the right data types, but really, I wanted to make it as open as possible. Coming from someone who's used a TON of productivity apps in the past, the more freedom them give the user the better they are generally.
