This is milindCal, the best productivity software ever created (ever).
What you do is you input the tasks you're wanting to remember, a short description of the task, how long you think it'll take, and it's relative importance. And then milindCal 
(the amazing lil piece of software it is) will organize the tasks for you in the order in which you should do them, helping you get things done the right way.
