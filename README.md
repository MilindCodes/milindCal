This is milindCal, the best productivity software ever created (ever).
What you do is you input the tasks you're wanting to remember, a short description of the task, how long you think it'll take, and it's relative importance. And then milindCal 
(the amazing lil piece of software it is) will organize the tasks for you in the order in which you should do them, helping you get things done the right way. It's algorithm sorts the tasks in inverse proporation to how long they take to complete and to how important the task is. There is some data validation such that you enter the right data types, but really, I wanted to make it as open as possible. Coming from someone who's used a TON of productivity apps in the past, the more freedom them give the user the better they are generally. 

I am also working on a corporate description of the app!
milindCal is a productivity app designed to help you stay organized and efficient. Simply input your tasks, along with their estimated completion time and priority level. The app's algorithm will then prioritize your tasks based on their urgency and importance, ensuring you're always working on the most impactful ones first.

With milindCal, you'll enjoy a flexible and user-friendly experience. Input tasks in your own way, without worrying about strict formatting. The app's intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate and manage your tasks, so you can stay focused and productive.

milindCal is more than just a to-do list. It's a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals and maximize your productivity. Download it today and experience the difference.

milindCal leverages a sophisticated algorithm to prioritize tasks with exceptional precision. This algorithm operates on the principle of inverse proportionality regarding task duration and direct proportionality concerning task importance. In essence, tasks that demand less time but carry greater significance ascend to the forefront of the priority queue. Conversely, tasks that are time-consuming but hold lesser importance are relegated to lower positions.

This ingenious approach draws inspiration from the rich tapestry of algorithmic history, dating back to the ancient Greeks and their pioneering work in geometry and logic. The concept of proportionality, a cornerstone of algorithmic thinking, has evolved and matured over centuries, finding applications in diverse fields such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

milindCal's algorithm meticulously calculates the relative weight of each task by considering its estimated duration and assigned priority level. Tasks with shorter estimated completion times are awarded a higher weight, reflecting their potential to be executed more swiftly. Conversely, tasks with longer estimated durations receive a lower weight, acknowledging the greater time investment required for their completion.

In parallel, the algorithm evaluates the importance of each task, assigning a corresponding weight based on the priority level assigned by the user. Tasks deemed critical or urgent are assigned higher weights, underscoring their need for immediate attention. Conversely, tasks deemed less important or less time-sensitive are assigned lower weights, reflecting their lower priority.

By meticulously considering both task duration and importance, milindCal's algorithm constructs a comprehensive priority ranking that accurately reflects the relative urgency and significance of each task. This intelligent prioritization empowers users to focus their efforts on the most impactful tasks, optimizing their productivity and ensuring that critical deadlines are consistently met.
